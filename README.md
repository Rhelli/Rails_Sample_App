# üîè Signing Up - A Sample Rails App

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

### Version History
As a part of an iteration of project built ontop of one another, you can find specifications about the previous versions below:
  v0.1.0 - ['Mostly Static Pages - Chapter 3'](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-4th-edition-tutorial/static_pages) - Generation of static and some dynamic pages using Rails. Basic skeleton building of the web app with testing via Minitest and Guard.

  v0.2.0 - ['Filling in the Layout - Chapter 5'](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-4th-edition-tutorial/filling_in_the_layout) - Utilisation of the Rails asset pipeline with Bootstrap and SCSS. Generation and routing of the sites pages and links. Testing for site routing added.

  v0.3.0 - ['Modeling Users - Chapter 6'](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-4th-edition-tutorial/modeling_users) - Generation of user models and preliminary structuring of the sites database. Validations and password security implemented with more tests for each.


## üéõÔ∏è Version 0.4.0 - The Project Brief

This project carries on from a previous finished project. Building upon ['Chapter 6 - Modelling Users'](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-4th-edition-tutorial/modeling_users), from the ['Michael Hartl Rails tutorials'](www.learnenough.com). In this project, we focus on creating the long-awaited user sign-up page which allows for the creation of new users. This is all implemented with Rails form-builders.

  - New sign-up forms allow for user creation and saving to the database in one go;
  - Redirection to the users profile upon new user creation with flash notices;
  - Profile gravatars;
  - Validation errors upon signing up are now 'prettified' and displayed to the user
  - Greater implementation of integration testing to verify submission behaviour and catch regressions
  - SSL configuration for greater secruity and defaulting to Puma for a higher webserver capacity.
